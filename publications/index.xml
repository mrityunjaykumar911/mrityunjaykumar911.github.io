      <description>This talk looked at the nuances of deployment of Machine Learning models in production. In current era, when CI &amp;amp; CD are supported for almost all type of applications developed and with integration with services like GCP, AWS; one can deploy scalable solution at instant.
However, the idiosyncratic complexity for deployment of Machine learning model in robust system is still a mystry and many firms have invested for add-on frameworks for developing a comparable solution to push it to production environemnt, but many still face the challanges like scalability, latency etc.</description>

      <description>GOAL The goal of the project is to find techniques to generate application-specific fingerprints for data. There are many machine learning applications that need to incrementally evolve in their ability to process data. When data does not match the processing ability, we see unexpected results and system misbehavior. If we are able to generate fingerprints for classes of data, and if we can discard data that does not match known fingerprints, then we have better control over how unexpected data can influence underlying algorithms.</description>

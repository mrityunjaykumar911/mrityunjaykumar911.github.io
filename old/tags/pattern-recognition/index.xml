      <description>Title:
Fingerprinting Latent Structure in Data
Abstract:
As data-hungry algorithms find wide spread applications, there is an increased interest in exploring these algorithms in the context of small-data. In many niche industrial applications, data is not only held in secrecy for reasons of privacy and competitive advantage, but is also limited in volume and variety. Under these constraints, data-driven algorithms are expected to exhibit low application misbehavior. If one can discard data that does not match capabilities of underlying algorithms, there is better control over how unexpected data can influence the application behavior.</description>

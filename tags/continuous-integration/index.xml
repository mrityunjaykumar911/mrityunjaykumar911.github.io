      <description>This talk looked at the nuances of deployment of Machine Learning models in production. In current era, when CI &amp;amp; CD are supported for almost all type of applications developed and with integration with services like GCP, AWS; one can deploy scalable solution at instant.
However, the idiosyncratic complexity for deployment of Machine learning model in robust system is still a mystry and many firms have invested for add-on frameworks for developing a comparable solution to push it to production environemnt, but many still face the challanges like scalability, latency etc.</description>
